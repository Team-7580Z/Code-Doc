# Subsystems
---
This year our robot had three subsystems. They were the chassis, rollers, and intake.
---

## Chassis
Our current robot utillizes the X-Drive as its chassis. In the code side we have built odemntry into our robot. We also have a PD loop that will alow us to move along the y-axis, x-axis, and turn.

## Ball system
Our robot has 5 rollers that will allow us to bring a ball from the intake and score it in a goal. Also we can shot the other alliances ball out of the back. In our code we have functions made to allow us to code auntmous and driverControll easier. We also have a autosort which enables us to descore the other alliances ball completely automaticly.\

Our rollers also work along side our intake with a descore function we have built.
